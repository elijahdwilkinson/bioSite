        <h2> A little about me... </h2>
        <p >Hunter is a man of many talents and a man of many passions. From ripping his motorcycle on the streets and on track, to penning beautiful and relatable low-tempo songs that speak to the unhealed, angsty teenager inside all of us, Hunter is a veritable jack of all trades, and surprisingly a master of some as well. 

            Hunter spent his formative years in Providence, Rhode Island but his family relocated to Buffalo, NY during his adolescence. It was there in Western New York Hunter began experimenting with motorsports, the musical arts, as well as video games as a recreational hobby. It was also here that he attended university at the University at Buffalo where he was a short-time Environmental Studies major before changing course to pursue his true academic and professional passion in Biology and medicine.

        <p> When Hunter isn’t at the lab, he could most likely be found rock climbing with his fiance, tending to his newly purchased home, or even tutoring young adults in music. You wont catch him out and about on a Friday evening, as he’ll most likely be inside working on his EP, playing a few shooting or fantasy RPGs with his family or friends, or just lounging and enjoying some time in between competing priorities and responsibilities. 
            
            With a list of accomplishments in both the past and present, Hunter has an eye towards the future as well, seeking to become a Spotify published artist, and if he has any luck, he’ll look to get his music incorporated into a game from his favorite game developer: Naughty Dog.</p>
