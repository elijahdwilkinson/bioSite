        <h2>Home Ownership</h2>
            <p>In 2022 Hunter purchased his first home, achieving a socio-economic goal that he's always had on his radar and scarce believed he'd ever actually accomplish. He even has a Hobby room where he can write and record his music. </p></div>

        <h2>Professional Career and Aspirations</h2>
        <p>Hunter was fortunate and talented enough to land a solid job at a NY-stationed medical research lab and is pursuing the career he wants. Although not quite at the level he aspires to be at, he's made excellent strides the past couple years 
            and is extremely proud of his accomplishments. Working in med-research is no easy feat, not matter what level you're at.

        <h2>Featured Musician</h2>
            <p>Although more of a future goal than a current achievement, Hunter aspires to have his music featured in an upcoming project by his favorite game developer: Naughty Dog. Certainly a tall order, but I admire Hunter's dedication to this
                goal
