        <h2>Guitar and Music</h2>
            <p>Hunter picked up a guitar and developed a keen interest and talent for performance. Not only is he an accomplished musician in his own right having experience with guitar, piano, & vocals, but he also spreads
                the joy of music by teaching theory and offering lessons as well. His preferred genre is alt-rock, and his lyrical content harnesses the powerful feelings of discontent many experience due to socio-economic factors beyond their control. </p></div>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Hunter's preferred games are FPS, such as Call of Duty and Destiny 2, although he also enjoys RPGs like Diablo and Baldur's Gate. He likes the fast-paced responsiveness of shooters, but finds a lot of value in RPGS that give you great freedom over 
            how you build your character. Destiny 2 offers a great balance, with accessible PvP as well as flexibility in how you structure your character's loadout.

        <h2>Motrocycles & Motorsports</h2>
            <p>Ever a fan of tactile experiences and competition, Hunter found a great passion in motorsports. Whether it's wrenching on his bike and taking a leisurely but spirited ride through twisty backroads, or taking out the R6 to do some track duty and 
                gauge his skills against others, he has found great satisfaction in motorcycles and racing.
